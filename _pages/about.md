Welcome! I am a labor economist studying the U.S. criminal justice system and the social safety net. My current research studies the role of incentives in shaping human decision-making and patterns of inequality and the intergenerational effects of household resources.

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Colorado Denver.
