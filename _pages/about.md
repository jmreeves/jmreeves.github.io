Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan. 

My research interests are in labor economics with an emphasis on the role of incentives in shaping human decision-making and patterns of inequality, particularly for agents in the criminal justice system. My current work also examines how firm behavior and the design of the social safety net affect household resources and socioeconomic well-being.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**
