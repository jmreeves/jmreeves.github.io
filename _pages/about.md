Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan. 

My research interests are in labor economics with an emphasis on the role of incentives in shaping human decision making and patterns of inequality, particularly for agents in the criminal justice system. My current work also develops tools to quantify the effect of policies on group disparities and examines the impact of firm behavior and household resources on socioeconomic well-being.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**
