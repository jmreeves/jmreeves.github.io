**[Voting and Political Participation in the Aftermath of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/AIDSMortalityAndVoting.pdf)** with Hani Mansour
<br/>*Forthcoming at Journal of Human Resources.*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This study examines the effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the public health response to it on political behaviors. Using data on elections to the U.S. House of Representatives and leveraging cross-district variation in HIV/AIDS mortality during the period 1983-1987, we find that, beginning with the early 1990s, exposure to HIV/AIDS mortality increased the vote share, voter turnout, and contributions made to Democratic candidates. The increased support for Democrats is larger in competitive districts. The results are consistent with HIV/AIDS mortality impacting cultural attitudes and leading to broader and persistent changes in voting patterns and political participation.

**[JUE Insight: Condominium Development Does Not Lead to Gentrification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022001000)** with Leah Boustan, Robert A. Margo, Matthew M. Miller, and Justin Steil <br/>*Journal of Urban Economics*, 133: 103524, 2023. *[Pre-publication version](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/CondoGentrification.pdf)*, *[Online appendix](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/CondoGentrification_OnlineAppendix.pdf)*

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Many politicians and voters believe that condominium development hastens gentrification. Indeed, there is a strong positive correlation between the presence of condos in a neighborhood and resident socio-economic status. We leverage the introduction of municipal regulations to study the causal effect of condo conversions on neighborhood attributes. Cities that restricted condo conversions experience a persistent decline in the condo share of the housing stock, relative to their neighboring suburbs and compared to metropolitan areas without such restrictions, even at city/suburb borders. Yet, areas with a higher condo share due to local regulations do not have residents with higher income or education levels.

## Working Papers
**[The Direct and Intergenerational Effects of Criminal History-Based Safety Net Bans in the U.S.](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/SafetyNetBans.pdf)** with Michael Mueller-Smith, Kevin Schnepel, and Caroline Walker
<br/>*NBER Working Paper No. 31983.*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We study the lifetime banning, as introduced by United States Public Law 104-193, of individuals convicted of felony drug offenses after August 22, 1996 from ever receiving future SNAP benefits. Using a regression discontinuity design that leverages CJARS criminal history records with federal administrative and survey data, we estimate the causal impact of safety net assistance bans, finding significant reductions in SNAP benefit take-up, which creates unintentional spillovers to spouses and children and persist long after ban revocations occurred. While we observe limited changes to other adult outcomes, childrenâ€™s cognitive and educational outcomes worsen, especially those impacted at young ages.

**[Agency Incentives and Disparate Revenue Collection: Evidence from Chicago Parking Tickets](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/AgencyIncentivesRevenue.pdf)** with Elizabeth Luh and Benjamin Pyle
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We examine enforcement patterns in administering parking tickets for failure to purchase vehicle registration, colloquially known as the sticker fine, across ticketing agencies in Chicago. Leveraging a sharp 2012 sticker fine increase in an event-study framework, we find that Chicago police increased their enforcement of sticker non-compliance across Black relative to non-Black neighborhoods, but find no disparate response in the ticketing behavior of other parking enforcement agents. This significant disparity in ticketing by police officers is not driven by changes in compliance or differences in neighborhood characteristics, but rather differential enforcement. We present suggestive evidence of differences in officer incentives and marginal parking enforcement costs as key mechanisms. An officer-specific decomposition provides evidence that disparate enforcement is not concentrated among a small handful of officers, but is instead a broader departmental phenomenon. We link this disparate enforcement to a widening of the financial instability gap across neighborhoods, including increased rates of ticket non-payment and bankruptcy filings.

**[Gender Differences in Political Career Progression](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/CareerPathGenderGap.pdf)** with Ryan Brown, Hani Mansour, and Stephen D. O'Connell
<br/>*Revision Requested at Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization.*
<details>
 <summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper quantifies the gender gap in the returns to electoral success on the career progression of novice U.S. state legislators. Winning a state legislature race increases the probability that female state legislators compete for and win a higher-level seat by more than 150% compared to male winners. We provide evidence that these larger returns to winning a state legislative election are consistent with voters or party elites updating their beliefs about female candidates. Specifically, we find that female, but not male, state legislators are more likely to progress up the political hierarchy when working in full-time state legislatures, when representing a larger constituency, when working in a cohort with fewer men, and when serving in districts with limited prior exposure to female candidates. These results have important policy implications for how to promote women in politics in order to increase the share of female politicians in leadership positions.
