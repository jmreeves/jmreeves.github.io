## Publications
**[JUE Insight: Condominium Development Does Not Lead to Gentrification](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/CondoGentrification.pdf)** with Leah Boustan, Robert A. Margo, Matthew M. Miller, and Justin Steil, <br/>*Accepted at Journal of Urban Economics.*
<br/>
<sub>**Abstract:** Many politicians and voters believe that condominium development hastens gentrification. Indeed, there is a strong positive correlation between the presence of condos in a neighborhood and resident socio-economic status. We leverage the introduction of municipal regulations to study the causal effect of condo conversions on neighborhood attributes. Cities that restricted condo conversions experience a persistent decline in the condo share of the housing stock, relative to their neighboring suburbs and compared to metropolitan areas without such restrictions, even at city/suburb borders. Yet, areas with a higher condo share due to local regulations do not have residents with higher income or education levels.<sub/>

**[Voting and Political Participation in the Aftermath of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/AIDSMortalityAndVoting.pdf)** with Hani Mansour,
<br/>*Forthcoming at Journal of Human Resources.*
<br/>
<sub>**Abstract:** This study examines the effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the public health response to it on political behaviors. Using data on elections to the U.S. House of Representatives and leveraging cross-district variation in HIV/AIDS mortality during the period 1983-1987, we find that, beginning with the early 1990s, exposure to HIV/AIDS mortality increased the vote share, voter turnout, and contributions made to Democratic candidates. The increased support for Democrats is larger in competitive districts. The results are consistent with HIV/AIDS mortality impacting cultural attitudes and leading to broader and persistent changes in voting patterns and political participation. <sub/>

## Working Papers
**[Gender Differences in Political Career Progression](https://jmreeves.github.io/files/CareerPathGenderGap.pdf)** with Ryan Brown, Hani Mansour, and Stephen D. O'Connell,
<br/>*IZA Discussion Paper No. 12569, CESifo Working Paper No. 7821.*
<br/>
<sub>**Abstract:** We quantify the gender gap in political career progression from state to national levels among U.S. politicians and study its underlying causes. Using a close elections strategy, we find that an additional state legislature term increases the probability of ever running for Congress by twice as much for men as it does for women in otherwise comparable elections. The effect on winning a Congressional race is four times larger for men than women. These gaps emerge early in legislators’ careers, widen over time, and are seen alongside a higher propensity of female politicians to continue running for the state legislature. The gap cannot be attributed to differences in experience, career-family tradeoffs, election or constituency characteristics, nor preferences for part-time public service careers.<sub/>
